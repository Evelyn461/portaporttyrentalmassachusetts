                <h2 class="template4 h2alooma" style="margin-left: 400px; font-size: larger; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:medium;">How do you ensure the portable toilets don't have unpleasant odors?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We use a multi-faceted approach. First, our units are thoroughly sanitized between every use. Second, we use a high-quality, eco-friendly deodorizing chemical in the tank that neutralizes odors at the source. Finally, all our units are designed with ventilation stacks to promote continuous airflow, keeping the interior fresh.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">Can a portable toilet be placed inside a building, like a warehouse or a structure under construction?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Yes, under certain conditions. The unit must be placed in an area with adequate ventilation, and there must be a clear, accessible path for our service truck to get close enough to the unit to service it with its vacuum hose. We can assess the site to determine if an indoor placement is feasible.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">How do you determine the correct number of portable toilets for an event?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We use a standard industry formula that considers the number of guests, the duration of the event, and whether alcohol will be served (which typically increases usage by about 20%). Simply give us those three details, and our experts can provide you with a precise and reliable recommendation to avoid lines and ensure comfort.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">What if we run out of toilet paper or hand sanitizer before our next scheduled service?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">While we stock our units generously based on anticipated usage, this can occasionally happen on high-traffic sites. Just give our office a call, and we will do our best to dispatch a driver to drop off additional supplies to tide you over until your next full service.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">How much notice do I need to give to rent a potty near me?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">For standard units, we can often accommodate requests with 24-48 hours' notice, depending on availability. However, for specialty units like our luxury restroom trailers or for large orders, we highly recommend booking two to four weeks in advance, especially during peak seasons, to guarantee availability.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">What happens if the portable toilet is tipped over or vandalized?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Please contact us immediately if any damage occurs. For your peace of mind, we offer an optional damage waiver for a small fee, which covers you in the case of most accidental damage or vandalism. Without the waiver, the renter is responsible for the cost of repairs or replacement.</p>
